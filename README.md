# to_do_list

When we open the application, we see 3 things to do.
To write what we want to do, we press the plus button in the lower right corner and add what we will do. Every time we add, 3 Tasks under To Do List text increase.
So how do we tell if we've done it or not? If we have completed the task, we click on the box next to it. Each time we click, a line appears above the text.
What if we want to delete the task? When we press and hold on our task, our task is deleted.
